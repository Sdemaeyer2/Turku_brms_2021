# 1.   Aims &amp; practical stuff

.footnote[[&lt;i&gt; get me back to the topic slide&lt;/i&gt;](#topicslide)]

---
## My aims  are ...
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
- to give some background on Bayesian statistics without getting too technical (I hope)
- to get you familiar with a basic workflow for a Bayesian analysis making use of .UA-red[ `brms`] and other great packages
- to let you apply what's learned on your data (so it's hands-on)
- to supply you with .UA-red[ `R code`] that may inspire
- to share some great sources

---

## All material is shared...

&lt;br&gt;

On Github there is a dedicated repository where you'll find:

- the Rmarkdown files for the slides
- annotated R scripts
- saved models from the slides (some take too long to estimate 'live')
- data used for the exercises

&lt;br&gt;

The Github repository can be accessed using the following link:

&lt;br&gt;

The slides are on my Talks site [https://slides-sdemaeyer.netlify.app/]

---

## Zoom 
&lt;br&gt;
Recordings

&lt;br&gt;

Please ask questions and interfere! Just give a shout! 

&lt;br&gt;

Stuck with some exercises? 

`\(\rightarrow\)` Share your screen and we will try to help

---
##Your own data

Day 2: 

- some dedicated time to apply stuff to your own data
- be prepared:
  - think about some (simple) models (and possible priors...)
  - prepare your data  to avoid a lot of data issues on day 2
  - for the brave: try some modelling at home before day 2

---
name: Prerequisites

##Prerequisites

- be familiar with R
- have `CmdStan` &amp; `cmdstanr` up and running (see https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html)
- have `brms` installed
- have `tidyverse` installed


I will often use the .SW-greenD[functional programming] style making use of the pipe operator (works if `tidyverse` is loaded):


```r
A %&gt;% B
```

This reads as .UA-red[take A] and then .UA-red[do B] 

An example:


```r
c(1,2,3,4,5) %&gt;% mean()
```

reads as .UA-red[create a vector of the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5] and then .UA-red[calculate the mean]

## What's Bayesian inference about?

.footnote[[&lt;i&gt; get me back to the topic slide&lt;/i&gt;](#topicslide)]
---
## First things first...

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

What is &lt;b&gt;.SW-greenD[statistical inference]&lt;/b&gt; about?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

In your definition, what is a &lt;b&gt;.SW-greenD[statistical model]&lt;/b&gt;?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

What are &lt;b&gt;.SW-greenD[parameters]&lt;/b&gt;?

## Frequentist vs. Bayesian inference

## To get us started...

.left-column[
&lt;img src="Van_Helsing_1931.png" width="110%" height="110%" /&gt;
]

.right-column[
- prof. dr. Von Helsing (a famous Vampire Hunter)

- How many Vampires are out there?

- Time for his famous .UA-red[Vampire Test]

- Sample of 200 citizens

- Result: 10.5%  = Vampire

- Ok, but what about the population?
]

---

## What a Frequentist approach can tell us

Make a Confidence Interval for the 10.5%:

- Estimate the sampling error:

  * sampling error: 0.0217

- Calculate upper and lower limit of the 95% CI:

  * lower: 0.0625
  * upper: 0.1475

- Inference:

&gt; In 95% of the samples (of sample size 200) we would get a percentage vampires varying somewhere between 6.25% and 14.75%

---

## The Bayesian approach

.left-column[
Before Von Helsing gathers data he had no knowledge at all! 

If we visualize this 'prior knowledge' it could look like this.]

.right-column[

&lt;img src="Part1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="576" /&gt;
]
---
## The Bayesian approach

.left-column[

Von Helsing starts testing ...

First tested person is NOT a Vampire!

So, 100% of Vampires is already less probable.

Time to adjust our knowledge

.right-column[
&lt;img src="Part1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="576" /&gt;

.right-column[
&lt;img src="Part1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="576" /&gt;
]
---

## The Bayesian approach

.left-column[
We get a probability for each possible percentage of vampires. 

* plot it in a .UA-red[probability density] plot

* summarize: e.g. 90% most probable values are situated between 7.5% and 14.8%

## Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Bayesian analyses
&lt;br&gt;

Advantages:

- Natural approach to express uncertainty
- Ability to incorporate prior knowledge
- Increased model flexibility
- Full posterior distribution of the parameters
- Natural propagation of uncertainty

&lt;br&gt;

Disadvantage:

- Slow speed of model estimation
- Some reviewers don't understand you (&lt;i&gt;"give me the p-value"&lt;/i&gt;)

## Bayesian Theorem

&lt;img src="prior_data_posterior.png" width="50%" height="50%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

$$
P(\theta|data) = \frac{P(data|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(data)}
$$
&lt;br&gt;

with 

- `\(P(data|\theta)\)` : the .UA-red[likelihood] of the data given our model `\(\theta\)`
- `\(P(\theta)\)` : our .UA-red[prior] belief about model parameters 
- `\(P(\theta|data)\)`: the .UA-red[posterior] probability about model parameters

  `\(L(\theta|data)\)`

.right-colomn[

&lt;br&gt;

Actually this is our .UA-red[&lt;b&gt;model&lt;/b&gt;] part

## Likelihood

.left-column[
Example: 

.SW-greenD[&lt;i&gt;What if we want to model how fast people can run a 1OK?&lt;/i&gt;]

Data = 10 observations (Running times for 10K in minutes)


```
##  [1] 52 54 58 48 41 49 72 53 64 62

The model (&lt;i&gt;normal distribution&lt;/i&gt;):

`\(y_i \backsim N(\mu, \sigma)\)`

The parameter values that maximize the likelihood of our data:

## Prior
.center2[
.SW-greenD[
Expression of our prior knowledge (belief) about probable parameter values as a probability density function
]
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt;&lt;i&gt;"For Bayesians, the data are treated as fixed and the parameters vary. [...] Bayes' rule tells us that to calculate the posterior probability distribution we must combine a likelihood with a prior probability distribution over parameter values." &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt; (Lambert, 2018, p.88)

## Prior

Example: 

.SW-greenD[&lt;i&gt;What if we want to model how fast people can run a 1OK?&lt;/i&gt;]

.pull-right[
### Informative

When including significant information is crucial 

-   previously collected data
-   results from former research/analyses
-   data of another source
-   theoretical considerations

## Say we have following priors


```r
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
curve( dnorm( x , 50 , 20 ) , from=1 , to=200 ,xlab="mu", main="Prior for mu")
curve( dunif( x , 1 , 40 ) , from=-10 , to=50 ,xlab="sigma", main="Prior for sigma")
```

## Calculate the Posterior by hand (aka .UA-red[grid approximation])
.pull-left[

```r
# sample some values for mu and sigma
mu.list &lt;- seq(from = 30, 
               to = 90, 
               length.out=200)
sigma.list &lt;- seq(from = 2, 
                  to = 30, 
                  length.out = 200)
post &lt;- expand.grid(mu = mu.list, 
                    sigma = sigma.list)

# Calculate the loglikelihood of the data
# for each parameter value
post$LL &lt;- 
  sapply(1:nrow(post), 
    function(i) sum(
      dnorm(
        RT ,
        mean=post$mu[i] ,
        sd=post$sigma[i] ,
        log=TRUE ) ) )
```

]
.pull-right[

```r
# Calculate posterior as product 
# of LL and Prior
# but you see a '+ sign' 
# because we put everything on the 
# log scale 
# (to avoid getting zero's 
#  due to rounding in R)

post$prod &lt;- post$LL + 
  dnorm(post$mu, 50 , 10 , TRUE) + 
  dunif(post$sigma , 1 , 40 , TRUE)

# Re-scale the posterior 
# to the probability scale
post$prob &lt;- exp(post$prod - 
                   max(post$prod)
                 )
```
]

---

## Visualise the posterior distribution

&lt;i&gt; Make a contour plot &lt;/i&gt;

.pull-left[


```r
# Sampling going on
# So for reproducibility

set.seed(1975)

post %&gt;%
  # sample 10000 rows
  # with replacement
  # higher prob higher prob to 
  # be sampled
  sample_n(size = 10000, 
           replace = TRUE, 
           weight = prob) %&gt;%
  
  # create the plot
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = sigma)) +
  geom_density_2d_filled() + 
  theme_minimal()
```
]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="Part1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="432" /&gt;
]

---

## Visualise the posterior distributions

&lt;i&gt; Or sample from posterior and plot simple density plots &lt;/i&gt;


```r
sample.rows &lt;- sample(1:nrow(post), size=10000, replace=TRUE, prob=post$prob)

sample.mu &lt;- post$mu[sample.rows]
sample.sigma &lt;- post$sigma[sample.rows]
```

.pull-left[


```r
plot(density(sample.mu),main="mu")
```

&lt;img src="Part1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="288" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

```r
plot(density(sample.sigma),main="sigma")
```

## 3. Why `brms`?

.footnote[[&lt;i&gt; get me back to the topic slide&lt;/i&gt;](#topicslide)]
---
## Imagine

A 'simple' linear model

&lt;br&gt;

`$$\begin{aligned}
  &amp; RT_{i}  \sim N(\mu,\sigma_{e_{i}})\\
  &amp; \mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1*\text{Weigth}_{i} + \beta_2*\text{Height}_{i} + \beta_3*\text{Age}_{i} + \beta_4*\text{WeeklyTrainingHours}_{i} + \beta_5*\text{Gender}_{i} \\
\end{aligned}$$`

&lt;br&gt;

So you can get a REALLY LARGE number of parameters!

---
## Markov Chain Monte Carlo - Why?

Complex models `\(\rightarrow\)` Large number of parameters `\(\rightarrow\)` exponentional number of combinations!

&lt;br&gt;

Posterior gets unsolvable by grid approximation

&lt;br&gt;

We will approximate the 'joint posterior' .SW-greenD[by 'smart' sampling]

&lt;br&gt;

Samples of combinations of parametervalues are drawn

&lt;br&gt;

BUT: .SW-greenD[samples will not be random!]

---
## MCMC - demonstrated

.center2[
Following link brings you to an interactive tool that let's you get the basic idea behind MCMC sampling:

https://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/app.html#HamiltonianMC,standard
]


---
## Software

&lt;br&gt;

- different dedicated software/packages are available: JAGS / BUGS / Stan

&lt;br&gt;

- most powerful is .UA-red[Stan]! Specifically the *Hamiltonian Monte Carlo* algorithm makes it the best choice at the moment


&lt;br&gt;


- .UA-red[Stan] is a probabilistic programming language that uses C++ 

---

## Example of Stan code

.scriptsize[

```
## // generated with brms 2.14.4
## functions {
## }
## data {
##   int&lt;lower=1&gt; N;  // total number of observations
##   vector[N] Y;  // response variable
##   int prior_only;  // should the likelihood be ignored?
## }
## transformed data {
## }
## parameters {
##   real Intercept;  // temporary intercept for centered predictors
##   real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma;  // residual SD
## }
## transformed parameters {
## }
## model {
##   // likelihood including all constants
##   if (!prior_only) {
##     // initialize linear predictor term
##     vector[N] mu = Intercept + rep_vector(0.0, N);
##     target += normal_lpdf(Y | mu, sigma);
##   }
##   // priors including all constants
##   target += normal_lpdf(Intercept | 500,50);
##   target += student_t_lpdf(sigma | 3, 0, 68.8)
##     - 1 * student_t_lccdf(0 | 3, 0, 68.8);
## }
## generated quantities {
##   // actual population-level intercept
##   real b_Intercept = Intercept;
## }

name: brms_example

## 4. `brms` basic example

.footnote[[&lt;i&gt; get me back to the topic slide&lt;/i&gt;](#topicslide)]
---

## `brms` syntax
Very very similar to `lme4` and in line with typical R-style writing up of a model ...
.pull-left[
`lme4`


```r
Model &lt;- lmer(
  y ~ x1 + x2 + (1|Group),
  data = Data,
  
  
  
  ...
)
```
]


.pull-left[
`brms`


```r
Model &lt;- brm(
  y ~ x1 + x2 + (1|Group),
  data = Data,
* family = "gaussian",
* backend = "cmdstanr"
  
  ...
)
```
]

Notice: 

- `family = "gaussian"` indicates the "likelihood" function we will use
- `backend = "cmdstanr"` indicates the way we want to interact with Stan and C++

---

## Let's retake the example on running
.left-column[
Example: 

.SW-greenD[&lt;i&gt;What if we want to model how fast people can run a 1OK?&lt;/i&gt;]

&lt;img src="running.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" /&gt;

]

.right-column[
The simplest model looked like:

$$
RT_i \sim N(\mu,\sigma_e)
$$

In `brms` this model is:


```r
# First make a dataset from our RT vector
DataRT &lt;- data_frame(RT)

Mod_RT1 &lt;- brm(
  RT ~ 1, # We only model an intercept
  data = DataRT,
  backend = "cmdstanr",
  seed = 1975
)
```

.UA-red[&lt;b&gt;
.Large[ð]  Try it yourself and run the model ...
&lt;/b&gt;
]
]

---



&lt;img src="RT_Model1_Estimation.jpg" width="60%" height="60%" /&gt;

---
## But ...
.center2[
&lt;img src="MCMC_Skeleton.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /&gt;
]
---

## So

For the workshop all models are in the .SW-greenD[models] folder

You can normally read model information with `readRDS`

Here's an example:


```r
Mod_RT1 &lt;- readRDS(here("models", "Mod_RT1.RDS"))
```

This model information was saved with the `saveRDS` function:


```r
saveRDS(Mod_RT1, here("models", "Mod_RT1.RDS"))
```

.footnote[Notice that I use the package `here` allowing me to access files anywhere in the RStudio Projects folder using the `here( )` commando (no fuzz with paths on your computer)]

---

# MCMC = sampling

.left-column[
MCMC results will differ each time run 

&lt;br&gt;

Of course, not a lot if your model is good!

&lt;br&gt;

So, what if you want to be reproducible?

]


.right-column[


```r
Mod_RT1 &lt;- brm(
  RT ~ 1, # We only model an intercept
  data = DataRT,
  backend = "cmdstanr",
* seed = 1975 # make sure we get the same results each time :-)
)
```

]

---
## Good all `summary( )` function



```r
summary(Mod_RT1)
```

## Judging 'argumentative texts'


![alt text](DPAC__Groep_1_CJ__DMM_607-701_Page_1-2.png__Full_recordings__All_Participants.jpg)
---

## Procedure

- 26 high school teachers (Dutch) voluntary participated

- each did 10 comparisons of 2 argumentative texts from 10th graders

- 3 batches of comparisons with random allocation of judges to one of the batches

- all batches similar composition of comparisons regarding the characteristics of the pairs; the pairs, however not the same

- Tobii TX300 dark pupil eye-tracker with a 23-inch TFT monitor (max. resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels)

- data sampled binocularly at 300 Hz

## 6. Let's slightly increase complexity

## Question 1

.UA-red[&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; How much time do people spend in a text (in total) when comparing two texts? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;]

A simple model could look like:

$$
log(Time_i) \sim N(\mu,\sigma_e)
$$

with `\(Time_i\)` being the total time for each combination of participant, comparison and AOI_type

.small[

```r
Durations_CJ %&gt;%
  group_by(Partic, Compar, AOI_Type) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    Dur_Seconds = mean(Dur_Seconds),
    Dur_Log = mean(Dur_Log)
  ) %&gt;% head(5)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 5
## # Groups:   Partic, Compar [3]
##   Partic Compar      AOI_Type       Dur_Seconds Dur_Log
##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      1 DHH 214-425 AOI_LEFT_TEXT         7.12    6.61
## 2      1 DHH 214-425 AOI_RIGHT_TEXT       15.3     8.55
## 3      1 DLL 508- 51 AOI_LEFT_TEXT         4.61    7.31
## 4      1 DLL 508- 51 AOI_RIGHT_TEXT        3.28    6.63
## 5      1 DMH 414-609 AOI_LEFT_TEXT         1.93    6.82

## Question 1

First we make a dataset


```r
Data_CJ1 &lt;- Durations_CJ %&gt;%
  group_by(Partic, Compar, AOI_Type) %&gt;%
  summarize(
    Dur_Seconds = mean(Dur_Seconds),
    Dur_Log = mean(Dur_Log)
  )
```

Then we can run the model


```r
Model1_CJ &lt;- brm(
  Dur_Log ~ 1,
  data = Data_CJ1,
  family = "gaussian",
  backend = "cmdstanr",
  seed = 1975
)
```
