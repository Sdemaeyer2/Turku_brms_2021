This Turku_brms_2021 repo contains all the files for the workshop I gave on <i> Bayesian mixed effects models with`brms`</i>.

Here you will find the datasets, the slides and the rmarkdown file to create the slides (they contain the chunks of R code you can re-use).


In the folder with the name <i>Part 1</i> you can find the presentation as an `.rmd` file (Part1.Rmd) and as `.html` file (Part1.html). The htm-file can be opened with any browser. If you open the rmd-file in RStudio then you have immediate access to all the code.
